Now more than ever, cities are working to get data and information in the hands of residents to help them stay informed and make decisions, frequently in the form of open data, performance indicators, and strategic plans.

Johns Hopkins University Center for Government Excellence provides some tips and tools to elevate your city's community engagement efforts.
