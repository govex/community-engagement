\####Want to learn how to engage your community?

Now more than ever, cities are striving to put data and information into the hands of residents—empowering them to stay informed and make decisions. This often takes the form of open data portals, performance dashboards, and strategic plans. These tools allow residents not only to track progress on key priorities but also to analyze information and build their own solutions.

However, while government data has the potential to serve a wide range of stakeholders, it is often accessed and used by a small, familiar group—a core community of engaged users. To truly unlock the value of public data, cities must look beyond the “usual suspects” and find ways to reach a broader, more diverse audience.

How can cities ensure the data they share is accessible, relevant, and empowering for everyone who might benefit from it?

To assist cities in elevating community engagement efforts, the [Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University](http://govex.jhu.edu/), a partner in the [What Works Cities initiative](http://www.whatworkscities.org/), has created this playbook. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following best practices developed by the Center, cities will gain a greater understanding of community engagement.
