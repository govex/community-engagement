# Meeting Planning Toolkit

\####Chapter 6.2: Meeting Planning Toolkit

Having well-thought-out meetings requires a lot of preparation. The following checklist will help you work through the planning stage and ensure community engagement in the process.

#### **Whom Do You Plan to Invite?**

Your invite list should reflect a diverse cross-section of the community, including:

* Residents from a variety of neighborhoods
* Neighborhood association leaders
* Journalists and local media representatives
* Small business owners and entrepreneurs
* Civic tech and open data groups
* City staff (including both subject matter and data experts)
* University professors and students
* Librarians and other public service workers
* City leadership and elected officials

#### **How Will You Message the Meeting?**

When announcing the meeting:

* **Be clear about expectations**: Outline what participants are expected to contribute or learn.
* **State the logistics**: Clearly include the start and end time.
* **Connect to the bigger picture**: Explain how the meeting fits into broader city goals, such as improving data access, transparency, or community engagement.

#### **When Will the Meeting Be Held?**

Consider both the **timing** and the **city’s context**:

* Will a **weekday or weekend** better suit your audience?
* Check for **conflicting city events**, public holidays, or religious observances.
* If held in the evening, consider **offering childcare** to increase accessibility.

#### **Is the Location Appropriate?**

The location should be:

* **Convenient and accessible** to all invitees (ADA compliant, near public transit, safe area)
* **Neutral**, if building trust or inclusivity is a priority
* Hosted by the **city or a respected partner**, depending on your engagement goals

#### **How Will the Meeting Be Structured and Facilitated?**

Design the meeting to encourage participation:

* Use a **mix of large-group and small-group discussions**
* Ensure you have **enough facilitators** to support all groups
* Plan ways to include **all voices**, especially quieter or underrepresented participants
* Build in **time for reflection**, synthesis, or open Q\&A
* Prepare and bring all **necessary materials** (e.g., pens, notebooks, tablets)

Also consider:

* **Technical needs**: Power outlets, projectors, microphones
* **Refreshments**: Offer food and beverages, noting allergies or dietary restrictions

#### **How Will You Follow Up?**

Post-meeting, ensure continued engagement:

* Collect **contact information** (sign-in sheet, digital form, etc.)
* Let participants know **when and how they’ll hear from you next**
* Clearly communicate the **next steps** in the process—whether it’s a report, another meeting, or an opportunity for feedback
