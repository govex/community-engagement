####Chapter 6.6: Outreach Effectiveness Toolkit

Evaluating the effectiveness of your city’s engagement attempts is an important step in refining the process and continuing the conversation with your community. This could mean surveying participants after an event, calling for feedback in e-mail blasts, or sharing the results and progress with meeting attendees. Following up with stakeholders is key to making the engagement a positive experience and encouraging them to stay involved. The following is sample language your city could use in soliciting feedback from community stakeholders:

* How did you hear about this event?
* What did you like about this event?
* What didn’t you like about this event?
* What would attract you to an event like this in the future?
* Were the event’s objectives accomplished?
* Did you establish any new relationships with city staff or other event participants?
* Did you visit the city’s website/open data portal/social media sites/etc. after this event?
* Will you use the tools discussed during the event in the future?
* Do you feel that this event enabled you to share your thoughts and opinions?
* Do you feel that you can help shape governmental processes or services?
* Do you feel that you have a better understanding of how the government operates?
