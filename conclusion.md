There’s no single “right” way to engage with your community. Effective community engagement begins with clearly defining your goal, understanding your city and its residents, and using that insight to shape your engagement strategy. It’s an ongoing, adaptive process—one that may require trial and error. If something doesn’t work the first time, adjust and try again.

Lean on the experience of colleagues within your city and beyond. Reach out to academic institutions, civic tech groups, active residents, and even those who may be hesitant to participate. Every perspective has value. The more inclusive and responsive your approach, the stronger and more meaningful your community connections will become—and your efforts will pay off.
