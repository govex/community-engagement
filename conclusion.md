###Conclusion

There is no one right way to engage with your community. Community engagement requires identifying a goal, considering what you know about your residents and city, and acting on that knowledge to inform your cityâ€™s engagement plan. It is an iterative process with a lot of potential tools to help you along the way. If you do not get it right the first time, try and try again. Look to colleagues in your city and others for advice. Connect with academic institutions, civic tech groups, active residents, anyone willing to talk about community engagement with you, and even those who are hesitant to weigh in on the topic. Your efforts will pay off.
